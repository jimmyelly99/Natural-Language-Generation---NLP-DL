 # Word-Level Neural Language Model and Use it to Generate Text
 A language model that can predict the probability of next word in the sequence, based on the word already observed in the sequence 
 You will discover how to develop a statistical language model using deep learning in Python.     
 In this article, How to prepare text for developing a word-based language model. 
 
 How to design and fit a neural language model with a learned embedding and an LSTM hidden layer. 
 How to use the learned language model to generate new text with similar statistical properties as the source text.
 
 There are many techniques you can try to boost the accuracy of this model

 Try tuning following parameters to boost accuracy of the model:

 1) learning rate - alpha
 2) Beta - Momentum
 3)Optimizer - beta1, beta2, error 
 4) increase # of layers
 5) increase # of hidden nodes
 6) learning rate decay
 7) Mini batch size
 8) increase number of epochs
